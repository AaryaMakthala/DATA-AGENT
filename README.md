## Overview

Data Agent simplifies the traditional workflow of a data analyst. A user uploads a CSV file, and the system runs it through an automated pipeline that:

1. Profiles the dataset (row/column counts, data types, missing values, duplicates, outliers)
2. Detects columns that should be excluded from modeling (identifiers, GUIDs, indexes)
3. Identifies the most likely prediction target using a confidence-based scoring approach
4. Classifies the problem type (classification or regression)
5. Recommends machine learning algorithms suited to the dataset's characteristics
6. Generates an AI-written analysis report explaining patterns, correlations, and data quality issues
7. Produces an interactive dashboard of charts and visualizations
8. Applies AI-recommended cleaning steps to produce a cleaned, model-ready dataset

The goal is to make rigorous, explainable data analysis accessible to anyone, without requiring deep data science expertise.

A core design principle behind the system is that **the LLM never sees raw data**. Only a compact statistical profile of the dataset is passed to the language model, which keeps costs, latency, and data exposure to a minimum while all actual data manipulation is performed deterministically in Python.

## Core Workflow

```
Upload CSV Dataset
        |
        v
Dataset Profiling
        |
        v
Target Detection (on original, unencoded data)
        |
        v
Dataset Validation
        |
        v
   Valid? ----------- No ---> Invalid Dataset Report
        |
       Yes
        |
        v

   (Dataset Analysis + Cleaning Strategy)
        |
        v
Python Cleaning Engine
        |
        v
Visualization (before one-hot encoding)
        |
        v
ML Algorithm Recommendation
        |
        v
Report + Charts + Cleaned CSV
        |
        v
Interactive Dashboard
```

Two design decisions are worth calling out:

- **Target detection runs before preprocessing.** Encoding a categorical target (e.g. turning `Purchased` into `Purchased_Yes` / `Purchased_No`) destroys the semantic information needed to identify it, so detection always runs against the original dataframe.
- **Visualizations are generated before one-hot encoding.** Encoded categorical columns produce unreadable, fragmented charts, so all charting happens on the cleaned-but-not-yet-encoded data.

---

## Key Features

### Automated Dataset Profiling
The system analyzes uploaded CSV files and reports row/column statistics, data types, missing values, duplicates, outliers, unique value counts, and statistical summaries — all without sending the raw file to any LLM.

### Intelligent Target Detection
Rather than assuming the last column is the prediction target, the system uses a confidence-based scoring approach that evaluates column name semantics, business metric patterns, data type, cardinality, class imbalance, and general feature characteristics. Alternative target candidates are surfaced alongside their own confidence scores.

### Identifier Detection and Filtering
Columns that should never participate in machine learning — customer IDs, employee IDs, transaction IDs, GUIDs, and record indexes — are automatically detected and excluded from feature reasoning, correlation analysis, and chart generation.

### Machine Learning Algorithm Recommendation Engine
Algorithms are recommended based on actual dataset characteristics — size, feature composition, categorical ratio, outlier presence, class imbalance, and structure — rather than a static ranking.

| Problem Type | Recommended Algorithms |
|---|---|
| Classification | Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine |
| Regression | Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, Linear Regression |

Each recommendation includes a confidence score and a plain-language explanation of why the model fits the dataset.

### Data Quality and Cleaning Recommendations
The system detects missing values, outliers, and duplicate records, and generates a cleaning strategy covering imputation, outlier treatment, categorical encoding, and column removal. The LLM only produces the *plan* — every transformation is executed deterministically by the Python cleaning engine, so results are reproducible and free of hallucination.

### AI-Powered Analysis Reports
An LLM generates natural-language insights describing patterns, correlations, data quality issues, and modeling considerations found in the dataset profile.

### Interactive Data Visualizations
Charts are generated automatically, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, count plots, bar charts, missing value charts, and target distribution charts.

### Resilient Multi-Provider LLM Execution
The two LLM calls in the pipeline — dataset analysis and cleaning plan generation — are independent and run concurrently via a thread pool rather than sequentially. If the primary provider fails, the system automatically falls back to the next configured provider with no user intervention required.

### ML Validation and Testing
The project includes verification tests covering multiple dataset types (regression, classification with class imbalance, and invalid or single-class datasets) to confirm the pipeline correctly classifies problem type and rejects unusable data.

The LangGraph workflow runs the following node sequence:

```
START -> Profiler Node -> Target Detection Node -> Validation Node
      -> LLM Node (analysis + cleaning plan, run concurrently)
      -> Python Cleaning Node -> Visualization Node
      -> ML Recommendation Node -> END
```

If the validation node determines the dataset or detected target is unusable (for example, a single-class target), the workflow routes directly to `END` without invoking the LLM, cleaning, or visualization steps, and the frontend displays a clear invalid-dataset state instead of crashing.

**Why this architecture holds up:**

- **Privacy-first** — the LLM only ever receives a dataset profile, never the raw CSV, minimizing exposure of user data.
- **Deterministic processing** — AI decides *what* to do, while Python performs the actual cleaning, keeping results consistent and reproducible.
- **Modular workflow** — LangGraph separates every stage into an independent node, making the pipeline easy to extend, test, and debug.
- **Concurrent execution** — dataset analysis and cleaning-plan generation run in parallel via a thread pool, cutting overall processing time.
- **Graceful failure handling** — validation catches invalid datasets early, and the frontend surfaces meaningful error states.
- **Provider resilience** — automatic fallback across Gemini, Groq, and OpenRouter keeps the application functional if one provider is unavailable.
- **No database required** — every upload is temporary and outputs are stored as files, which keeps deployment simple.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- npm or yarn
- API keys for at least one supported LLM provider (Groq, Gemini, or OpenRouter)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Environment Variables

The backend requires the following environment variables, typically defined in a `.env` file within the `backend` directory:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | API key for the Groq LLM provider (primary) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | API key for the Gemini LLM provider (fallback) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key for the OpenRouter LLM provider (secondary fallback) |

---

## Testing

Backend verification tests can be run from the `backend` directory:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Tests cover target detection, problem type classification, class imbalance handling, and rejection of invalid or unusable datasets.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Asynchronous background processing via a task queue (Celery, Dramatiq, or RQ)
- [ ] Caching of dataset profiles to avoid recomputing results for identical uploads
- [ ] Interactive Plotly-based charts in place of static PNG images
- [ ] User authentication and persistent analysis history
- [ ] Explainable AI via SHAP feature importance for recommended models
- [ ] Support for Excel, Parquet, JSON, and compressed archive formats
- [ ] Data quality trend reports across multiple uploads
- [ ] Dockerized backend for consistent deployment across platforms
- [ ] Expanded automated test coverage across the full pipeline
- [ ] Upload security hardening: virus scanning, size limits, and stricter file-ID validation
